# A TODO List!

## Required Functionality

* Install error handlers for the exceptions I raise

## Advanced Functionality

* Support HTTPS and/or HMAC authentication to use the API
* Make the deployment approach be able to support deploying to other machines,
  including my home server, which has two TitanX's
* Use HMAC to generate the json hashes so that it cannot be easily reversed


## Documentation

* Write basic README.md to document how to use this repo, so you do not forget
  important processes or commands
* Create an interactive documentation website using mkdocs and the material
  theme
